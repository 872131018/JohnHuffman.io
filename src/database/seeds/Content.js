I am a capable PHP developer, but also have interest in other languages such as Python and Ruby, in particular the Django and Rails frameworks.  I also have a lot of experience with ES6 javascript and some of the top frontend frameworks around.  I have completed projects using Angular 2, Vue.js, and React/Redux.  I typically tackle problems with a hybrid single page application approach which involves compartmentalizing single page applications by functionality and leveraging server side logic to dictate which application is loaded and presented to the user.  This gives the developer the ability to manage a reasonable amount of code to manage for a given set of pages or features, while still allowing load times to be fast and lightweight."

        "content": "Aside from constantly coding on projects, I have several passions away from the keyboard.  I am an avid archer, working constantly to improve my form and accuracy.  My bow work comprises of not only modern shooting with carbon fiber and aluminum rigs, but also traditional shooting with longbows and military technique from antiquity.  I also enjoy fishing and golf from time to time. Come winter, you could find me at Arapahoe Basin or Beaver Creek carving the slopes.  Martial arts have been a lifelong study of mine as well.  Having practiced Tae Kwon Do, Kung Fu, Tai Chi, Aikido, and Jiu Jitsu I enjoy discussions and training revolving around martial arts practice and theory."
